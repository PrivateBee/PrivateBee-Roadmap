# Private Bee Roadmap

## Project Description 

GPS 4D is an innovative navigation system designed for **drones**, **air taxis**, and more generally for **next-generation aircraft** used in urban air mobility.

Unlike traditional navigation systems that rely on three-dimensional positioning (latitude, longitude, altitude), GPS 4D introduces a fourth essential dimension: **time**.

The objective of this project is to design a system capable of **planning**, **optimizing**, and **monitoring** aerial trajectories while simultaneously considering:

- **airspace geometry**,
- **regulatory constraints**,
- **real-time weather conditions**,
- **movements of other aircraft**,
- and **the urgency level of the mission**.

The system computes the **optimal trajectory** not only in **space** but also in **time**, in order to ensure **safer**, **faster**, and **more efficient** flights. It is also designed to dynamically adapt to **unexpected events** such as potential collisions, weather changes, restricted airspaces, or emergency situations.

## Repository Purpose

This repository acts as the Resource & Integration Library for the GPS 4D project. It centralizes all essential assets and external tools that support the ecosystem but are not part of the core flight or navigation codebases. Its goal is to provide a single point of access for research, design, and third-party communication tools.

Within the Private Bee ecosystem, this repository focuses on:

- External Application Logic: Hosting the source code for auxiliary tools, including Discord bots and monitoring dashboards used for team coordination and real-time project alerts.

- Academic & Technical Research: Curating a collection of white papers, state-of-the-art studies on 4D navigation, and comparative analyses of Urban Air Mobility (UAM) solutions.

- 3D Assets & Environment Models: Storing pre-existing 3D models (aircraft, urban buildings, obstacles) used in flight simulators and digital twin visualizations.

- Regulatory & Compliance Tracking: Maintaining a database of current aviation standards, drone regulations, and airspace safety protocols.

- Visual assets: Archiving UI/UX design mockups, logos.
